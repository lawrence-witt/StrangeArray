# StrangeArray

StrangeArray is a tool for developers to generate 3-D models of multi-dimensional JSON arrays directly in the browser, built using React, Redux, Three.js, and React-Three-Fiber. Users can input their own custom JSON data or build from scratch, with support for adding, deleting, and modifying elements before export.
